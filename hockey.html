    <h1>Hockey</h1>
    <p><b>Hockey</b> is a term used to denote various types of both <u>summer</u> and <u>winter</u> team sports which originated on 
        either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.</p>

    <p>There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. 
        In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another
         word i.e. "<b>field hockey</b>", "<b>ice hockey</b>", "<b>roller hockey</b>", "<b>rink hockey</b>", or "<b>floor hockey</b>".</p>

<p>In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, 
    either a type of ball or a <u>disk</u> (such as a <u>puck</u>), into the opponent's goal using a <i>hockey stick</i>.</p>
