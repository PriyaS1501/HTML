    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>Cricket is a <u>bat-and-ball</u> game played between two teams of <u>eleven players</u> each on a field at the centre of which 
        is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. </p>

<p>Forms of cricket range <b>from Twenty20</b>, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game 
    generally lasting three hours, <b>to Test matches</b> played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white 
    kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear 
    protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather 
    with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p>

<p><b><u>Women's cricket</u></b>, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. 
    The most successful side playing international cricket is <i>Australia</i>, which has <i>won seven One Day International 
    trophies</i>, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any 
    other country.</p>
