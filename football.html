    <h1>Football</h1>
    <p><b>Football</b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 
        Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular 
        where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer 
        in North America and Oceania); gridiron football <b>(specifically American football or Canadian football);</b> 
        Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
        These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as <b>football codes.</b> </p>

    <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different 
        parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these 
        games at English public schools during the 19th century.</p>

<p><i> The Football League</i> was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 
    During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports
     in the world.</p>
